# pipelex-starter-js

A minimal Next.js 16 starter that calls the [Pipelex](https://pipelex.com) API via the [`@pipelex/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipelex/sdk) SDK to run AI methods (`.mthds` bundles) from a TypeScript app.

It ships demo pipelines, presented as tabs:

- **Text entities** (`methods/extract-entities`) — extracts `{ people, orgs, dates }` from pasted text.
- **PDF summary** (`methods/summarize-pdf`) — uploads a PDF in the browser and returns a structured `{ title, doc_type, key_points }` summary from a cheap OpenAI model.
- **Image generation** (`methods/generate-image`) — turns a text prompt into an image with `gpt-image-2`.
- **Complex inputs** (`methods/complex-form`) — the same extraction with an optional structured input and a plural one, so the form has something to derive beyond a single text box. Its point is what the code does _not_ contain: `src/components/ComplexForm.tsx` is no longer than `EntityForm.tsx` and names no input.
- **Text stats** (`methods/text-stats`) — a method that does **not** live in this repo. `methods/text-stats/method.json` names a published package by address, and every file behind the tab was written by `make add-method` rather than by hand (see [Add a method](#add-a-method)).

Starting from zero? Use this template (next section). Adding Pipelex to an app you already have? This repo doubles as the worked example of the pattern — [`docs/adopt-in-an-existing-project.md`](docs/adopt-in-an-existing-project.md) is the transplant checklist.

## Use this template

This is a template repository — don't clone it directly. Click the green **Use this template** button at the top-right of the GitHub page to create your own repo, then clone that.

**Make it yours.** The fastest path is the bundled `/bootstrap` skill: open your new repo in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and run `/bootstrap`. It renames the template identity (`pipelex-starter-js` / `Pipelex Starter`) across `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, README, CLAUDE.md, the app title, metadata, release skill, and license text, then runs the checks.

Prefer to do it by hand? The manual equivalent:

1. Replace `pipelex-starter-js` in `package.json` with your npm package name, and update the description, author, repository, and license metadata.
2. Replace `Pipelex Starter` in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx` with your app title.
3. Update README.md, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE, and `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` so they describe your project instead of the template.
4. Run `npm install --package-lock-only` so `package-lock.json` matches the new package name and version.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19** + **TypeScript 5** (strict)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (configured in CSS — there is no `tailwind.config.ts`)
- **Vitest 4** + Testing Library (happy-dom)
- **ESLint 9** + **Prettier 3**, **Husky** + **lint-staged**
- **`@pipelex/sdk`** SDK for Pipelex API calls
- **`@pipelex/mthds-form`** form kernel — the input forms are rendered from each method's own contract

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12+ (the SDK is ESM-only and the e2e specs `require()` it, which needs Node's unflagged `require(esm)`)
- Access to the **hosted Pipelex API**, currently in private beta. Join the waitlist at [go.pipelex.com/waitlist](https://go.pipelex.com/waitlist); once you have access, get an API key at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com). `PIPELEX_BASE_URL` already defaults to `https://api.pipelex.com`, so the key is the only thing you set.

  **This template targets the hosted Pipelex API.** The hosted API is what serves everything the examples rely on — durable runs (start + poll), file upload and storage, and codegen. Dedicated deployments of the hosted plane exist and are not self-serve; talk to us at [pipelex.com](https://pipelex.com).

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local and set PIPELEX_API_KEY
make install
make dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:4300](http://127.0.0.1:4300) and try the example tabs. The server listens on loopback only — see [Where the app listens](#where-the-app-listens).

## How it works

Each example runs in one of **two execution modes**, switchable per-example at runtime with a small toggle:

- **Durable** (default) — the Server Action calls `PipelexApiClient.start()`, then the browser polls the run by id until it finishes, streaming live status. Survives the hosted gateway's ~30s synchronous cap, so long pipelines (like image generation) succeed.
- **Blocking** — the Server Action calls `PipelexApiClient.execute()` and waits. Simpler, but behind the hosted gateway a run over ~30s is cut off and surfaces a clear timeout error pointing you at Durable mode.

The flow, end to end:

1. A form renders its inputs with `useRunInputs(contract, descriptor)` + `<RunInputsForm>` — **no form field is written by hand**; every label, control and required-ness comes from the method's own wire input-form descriptor (co-walking its IO contract), both committed by `npm run codegen` (see [Input forms](#input-forms)). It then calls the `useRun({ mode, blocking, start, poll })` hook, which dispatches to the right **Server Actions** by mode.
2. The Server Action gates the same contract, applying the kernel's rules in full (a Server Action is a public endpoint; the browser's check is only UX), then names the method — reading its `.mthds` bundle from disk, or passing the selector its `method.json` manifest carries — and calls the SDK (`execute` for blocking, `start` + `getRunStatus`/`getRunResult` for durable) with it and the inputs.
3. The Pipelex API runs the pipe and returns the main output as `main_stuff` — the same resolved field on both paths.
4. A `parseXxx(results)` narrower in `src/types/` validates it into a typed shape, using a zod schema generated from the method's own `.mthds` bundle (see [Generated types](#generated-types)).
5. The hook drives the result: a live-status card while running, then `<RunResult>` — which renders the typed value from the method's own output-form descriptor, so **no result markup is written by hand either** — or a classified `PipelineError` shown by `<ErrorDisplay>`. Under a finished result, `<RunDetails>` shows the run's id, selectable with a Copy button, in either mode, and keeps the token-and-cost table one click away in a closed "Usage and cost" disclosure. The server logs the same id for every run.

## Input forms

**No form field in this app is written by hand.** Each form is rendered from its method's wire input-form descriptor by the [`@pipelex/mthds-form`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipelex/mthds-form) kernel: `npm run codegen` commits a `contracts.ts` beside the generated types — the method's IO contracts plus the descriptor, both from one `/v1/validate` call — the form derives its fields from it, and the Run button gates on whatever that method actually requires. Add an input to a `.mthds` bundle, re-run codegen, and it shows up with the right control and the right label — no component edit.

The same kernel supplies the input rules on **both** sides of the Server Action boundary, so there are no hand-written per-input guards left anywhere. The two sides call it differently, on purpose: the browser runs `computeReadiness` to decide whether Run is live, and the server runs `gateRunInputs` (`src/lib/runInputs.ts`), which calls readiness's own two functions over the same derived fields _and_ validates shapes _and_ builds the wire envelope. The server side is deliberately a strict superset — it is the trust boundary, because a Server Action is a public endpoint — and a test runs both sides over one table of inputs to hold them to it.

The **result** is the same idea on the other side of the contract. `npm run codegen` commits an output-form descriptor beside the input one, and `<RunResult>` renders the typed output through the kernel's result view: a structured concept becomes a labelled record, a plural one a table, a `native.Text` its typeset markdown, an image the picture with its file beneath it — all read off what the method declares, never off what the payload happens to look like. Change what a method produces, regenerate, and the view follows. There is no per-output component to keep in step, and a `JSON` tab sits beside the rendered view for whoever is debugging the pipe.

The full reference — the contract artifact, the server-side gate, the file seam, and the Tailwind setup (including the silent purge trap) — is [`docs/input-form.md`](docs/input-form.md).

### File & image inputs

Text inputs are plain strings. A file input (the PDF example) is stored the moment it is dropped, straight from the browser to Pipelex storage, so a run carries a reference and never the file:

1. The kernel's dropzone hands the app the dropped `File`. `useFileInputs` sends the file's name, type and size — never its bytes — to the method's grant action (`requestSummarizePdfUpload`), which holds the API key, checks the type and the size (`checkUploadRequest` in `src/lib/fileInputs.ts`, up to the platform's 50 MiB), and asks the API for an **upload grant**: a presigned, create-only `PUT` signed for exactly that file.
2. The browser sends the `File` itself with the SDK's `uploadWithGrant` (from the browser-safe `@pipelex/sdk/upload`), and writes the grant's `pipelex-storage://` reference into the form once storage has it. The bytes cross neither this app's server nor the API gateway.
3. The run's Server Action validates the shape against the contract, then the reference itself (`checkFileInputs`, which finds every file position by walking the method's own descriptor, so a list of documents or a file nested in a structured input is gated like a single one), and hands the inputs to `client.prepareInputs()`, which passes the stored reference through.

The kernel's file control also offers "paste a URL instead", so an `https://` or `pipelex-storage://` reference works without any upload at all. Those two schemes are the whole accepted set, checked before anything else: the SDK reads an unrecognised string as a path on the server's own disk, so a public Server Action has to refuse by default rather than assume "no bytes" means "nothing to check". A `data:` URL is refused too, because nothing in the app sends a file inline.

**The upload grant route is served only by a deployment that has it.** The hosted API serves `POST /v1/upload/grant` (verified on 2026-09-24 against both `api.pipelex.com` and `api-dev.pipelex.com`). Against a deployment without it, the PDF example says "File upload isn't available on this API" beside the field instead of storing the file.

Image **outputs** (the image example) come back as a URL — a storage URL or a base64 data URL — which renders directly in an `<img>`.

## Generated types

The typed shapes this app validates against are **not hand-written** — each one is projected from the `.mthds` bundle that declares it, so the TypeScript and the method cannot drift apart:

```bash
npm run codegen         # regenerate src/generated/ from methods/ — needs an API key
npm run codegen:check   # prove the committed trees are current — offline, no key
npm run codegen:verify  # ask the API whether the committed types are still semantically current — needs a key
```

`npm run codegen` sends each method to the API's `/v1/codegen` route, which returns a `types.ts` (zod schemas plus their inferred TypeScript types), a `binder.ts` (`parseXxx` / `serializeXxx` over those schemas), and a `codegen.lock`. It also asks `/v1/validate` for the method's input/output contracts and **both** of its form descriptors (`views: ["input_form", "output_form"]`) and writes a `contracts.ts`, which is what the input forms render from, what the run gate validates against, and what the result view is built from. The codegen artifacts carry a stamp and the lock records their hashes; `contracts.ts` is deliberately unstamped, tracked instead by its hash in `sources.json`'s `derived` map. Either way `npm run codegen:check` re-derives the whole verdict **offline** — no key, no network — and fails if a generated file was edited, deleted, or left behind. Beside each lock, that same `sources.json` records a hash of every source `.mthds`, which catches the other kind of staleness: editing a bundle and forgetting to regenerate. `make check` runs that check, so `make all` does too.

A few things worth knowing:

- **The generated trees are committed on purpose.** `git clone && make all` passes with no API key, and the diff of a regeneration is itself a readable summary of what a bundle edit changed.
- **Never edit a file under `src/generated/`** — the stamp stops matching and `make check` says so. Customize by wrapping instead: `src/types/*.ts` is exactly that wrapper layer, and it is where hand-written semantics belong (`parseGeneratedImage`, for instance, additionally checks that the image URL is one a browser can load).
- **Field names stay wire-native.** `DocumentSummary` is `{ title, doc_type, key_points }`, not a camelCase mirror — a hand-maintained mirror is the duplication this removes.
- **`src/generated/` is excluded from Prettier and ESLint** (see `.prettierignore`), because reformatting the files would break their stamps. TypeScript still checks them in full.

**After editing anything under `methods/`, run `npm run codegen`** and commit the result alongside the bundle. `make check` fails until you do.

A method directory holds either a `.mthds` bundle or a `method.json` manifest naming a method that lives elsewhere; `npm run codegen` regenerates both kinds in one pass, and bumping a published method's version is an edit to that manifest's tag plus a regeneration. See [`docs/codegen.md`](docs/codegen.md) for the two source kinds, and [Add a method](#add-a-method) for the gesture that writes either.

**Regeneration currently needs `PIPELEX_BASE_URL=https://api-dev.pipelex.com`.** Measured 2026-09-05: `api.pipelex.com` is on an older release that returns neither of `/v1/validate`'s `input_form` and `output_form` views (codegen needs both for every method) and does not advertise `method_ref` (which a package-sourced manifest needs). Both scripts say so rather than failing obscurely, and this is a deploy away. Nothing in the committed tree depends on it — `npm run codegen:check` is pure hashing, so `git clone && make all` passes with no key and no network either way.

## Add a method

One command turns a method into a new tab — a bundle you have on disk, a method saved under your organization on [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com), or one published as a package in a public repository:

```bash
make add-method METHOD=path/to/my_method.mthds                       # a bundle: a .mthds file, or a directory of them
make add-method METHOD=github.com/Pipelex/methods/text_stats@v0.1.1   # a published package
make add-method METHOD=mt_abc123…                                      # a method in your org's catalog
```

It writes the method's directory, the generated tree beside it, the narrower, the action trio, the form, an action test, and a tab entry — the same slice the demo tabs were written with by hand, and **you write neither the form fields nor the result view**: both come from the method's own descriptors. A bundle is copied into `methods/<name>/` (or scaffolded in place when it is already there), and its action reads the files at request time; a published or catalog method is named by a `methods/<name>/method.json` manifest and resolved server-side. The "Text stats" tab this template ships is the output of the second command, committed untouched, so you have something to diff your own run against.

The gesture is **one-shot** — it refuses rather than overwriting a slice that already exists, because the files it writes become yours the moment they land — and it writes nothing until everything has been fetched and rendered, so a refusal leaves the tree untouched. `npm run codegen` is the refresh afterwards: edit the bundle, or move a published method to a newer version by editing the tag in its manifest, then regenerate, and the run follows.

Useful arguments: `PIPE=<pipe_code>` when the method carries several pipes (without it, the method's own default is used, and a method with several pipes and no default is refused listing them), `NAME=` and `LABEL=` to override the derived directory name and tab label, and `DRY_RUN=1` to print the whole plan without writing anything. The `/mthds-build` skill from the [mthds-plugins](https://github.com/Pipelex/mthds-plugins) marketplace can write the bundle in the first place.

**It needs a key and a base URL that serves the form views** — see the note on `PIPELEX_BASE_URL` in [Environment variables](#environment-variables). The full reference is [`docs/add-method.md`](docs/add-method.md).

## Remove an example

Stripping the demos is usually the first act of making this template yours. Each example is one vertical slice; removing one (say `extract-entities`) means deleting, in one commit:

1. The bundle: `methods/extract-entities/`.
2. Its generated tree: `src/generated/extract-entities/` — `make check` fails on a generated tree with no method behind it (and vice versa), so always remove both together. Its `contracts.ts` goes with it, and with it the form that read it.
3. Its adapter in `src/types/extractEntitiesPipeline.ts` and its action trio `src/actions/runExtractEntitiesPipeline.ts`, each with its co-located `.test.ts`. There is no loader to remove: every action reads its bundle through the shared `loadMethodBundles`, naming its directory.
4. Its component — `EntityForm.tsx` and its test — and its tab entry in `src/components/ExampleTabs.tsx`, whose own test (`ExampleTabs.test.tsx`) mocks that form and asserts its tab. There is no result component to remove: every example renders the shared `<RunResult>`.
5. Its e2e spec: `e2e/extract.spec.ts`.
6. The references the shared code keeps to it. The text example is the form `e2e/error-display.spec.ts` drives — repoint it at a surviving example. The blurb in `src/app/page.tsx` names the examples, and the bundle-read hint in `src/lib/errors.ts` names this one by path. The complex-inputs example is additionally named by the shared gate test (`src/lib/runInputs.test.ts` imports its contract for the structured and plural rows).

Then run `make all`. `tsc` type-checks the co-located tests, so it names most dangling references itself; the two it cannot see — the `vi.mock` module string in `ExampleTabs.test.tsx` and the Playwright selectors — surface as test failures instead. The PDF example additionally owns `public/sample-invoice.pdf` and `src/types/summarizePdfUploads.ts`, and is named by the shared hook test `src/hooks/useRunInputs.test.tsx`; the image example is the one exercising the blocking-cap e2e case.

**A scaffolded example (`text-stats`) comes apart the same way**, `methods/text-stats/` holding a `method.json` manifest rather than a bundle. Leave the two `add-method:` anchor comments in `ExampleTabs.tsx` in place — `make add-method` inserts at them, and a test fails if they go missing.

## Where the app listens

`make dev` and `make start` listen on `127.0.0.1:4300`, which only this machine can reach. That is deliberate. The app's Server Actions run methods with the `PIPELEX_API_KEY` in the server's environment, and nothing authenticates the browser that calls them, so anyone who can reach the server runs methods billed to your key. Two variables change it, on the command line or from the shell:

| Variable   | Purpose                                                                                          | Default     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `APP_HOST` | The interface the server binds. `0.0.0.0` opens it to your network.                              | `127.0.0.1` |
| `APP_PORT` | The port, to run a second checkout beside one that already holds 4300: `make dev APP_PORT=4301`. | `4300`      |

Widen the host only on a network you trust, for a container or to open the app on another device: `make dev APP_HOST=0.0.0.0`. The Makefile prints a warning each time a server starts beyond loopback. `npm run dev` and `npm run start` read the same two variables and fall back to the same defaults.

## Make targets

| Target                | Purpose                                                                                                  |

| `make lint`           | ESLint                                                                                                   |

| `make format-check`   | Prettier check (CI)                                                                                      |
| `make typecheck`      | `tsc --noEmit` — app, e2e specs, and `scripts/`                                                          |
| `make codegen`        | Regenerate `src/generated/` from `methods/` (needs an API key — see [Generated types](#generated-types)) |
| `make codegen-check`  | Prove `src/generated/` is current — offline, no key (part of `make check`)                               |
| `make codegen-verify` | Ask the API whether the committed types still match the methods (needs an API key)                       |
| `make add-method`     | Scaffold a method into a new tab — `METHOD=<path \| mt_… \| address>` (needs an API key)                 |
| `make test`           | Vitest single pass (unit tests, no API call)                                                             |
| `make agent-test`     | Vitest, silent on success (for AI agents)                                                                |
| `make test-e2e`       | **Optional** Playwright e2e — live API, costs an LLM call (prompts first; auto-skips without a key)      |
| `make test-e2e-ui`    | Same, with the Playwright UI runner                                                                      |
| `make check`          | lint + format-check + typecheck + codegen-check                                                          |
| `make all`            | check + test + build (does **not** run e2e or `codegen` — both need a key)                               |
| `make use-local`      | Pack & install siblings `../pipelex-sdk-js` + `../mthds-form` into `node_modules` (alias: `ul`)          |
| `make use-npm`        | Restore the latest npm-published `@pipelex/sdk` + `@pipelex/mthds-form` packages (alias: `un`)           |

## End-to-end testing (optional)

The Playwright specs are **optional** — `make all` never runs them, and you can delete `e2e/` entirely if you don't want live tests. They open the dev server and exercise each example tab end-to-end, asserting the expected output.

The happy-path specs (`extract`, `summarize-pdf`, `generate-image`, `text-stats`) hit the **live** Pipelex API using `PIPELEX_API_KEY` from `.env.local`, so they cost an LLM call each. To keep that deliberate and safe:

- **They auto-skip without a key.** No `PIPELEX_API_KEY`? Those specs skip cleanly (you'll see them reported as skipped) instead of failing with an auth error — so a fresh fork can run `make test-e2e` before configuring credentials.
- **`make test-e2e` prompts for confirmation** before spending, since it costs money. The prompt is skipped in CI / non-interactive shells; pass `CONFIRM=1 make test-e2e` to bypass it in scripts.
- **It is excluded from `make all`.**
- `summarize-pdf` stores the sample PDF through an upload grant, so it also needs a base URL that serves `POST /v1/upload/grant`, which both hosted APIs do.
- Two specs need **no** key, cost nothing, and run out of the box: `home` renders the page and checks it hydrates cleanly, and `error-display` tests the offline error UX.
- A script driving the page waits for `html[data-hydrated]`, which the root layout sets once React has hydrated it. Acting earlier, a click or a dropped file never reaches its handler, and a screenshot raises a hydration mismatch of its own making.
- First-time setup needs the browser binary: `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Local package development (sibling `pipelex-sdk-js` and `mthds-form` repos)

If you have the [`pipelex-sdk-js`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-sdk-js) and [`mthds-form`](https://github.com/Pipelex/mthds-form) repos checked out as sibling directories (`../pipelex-sdk-js`, `../mthds-form`) and want this app to use them instead of the published npm packages:

```bash
make use-local   # builds both siblings, packs each with `npm pack`, installs the tarballs into node_modules/@pipelex/{sdk,mthds-form}
make use-npm     # installs the latest published @pipelex/sdk + @pipelex/mthds-form and re-pins package.json to them
```

Aliases: `make ul` / `make un`. **Re-run `make use-local` after every edit to either sibling** — the tarball is a snapshot, not a live link. We use a tarball install rather than a symlink because Next.js 16's Turbopack does not follow symlinked workspace packages (`Module not found: Can't resolve '@pipelex/sdk'`).

## Environment variables

| Variable                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                   | Default                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `PIPELEX_BASE_URL`           | Pipelex API base URL. Running the examples needs no override; `npm run codegen`, `codegen:verify` and `make add-method` currently do — see the note below | `https://api.pipelex.com` |
| `PIPELEX_API_KEY`            | Bearer token used by the SDK                                                                                                                              | (required at runtime)     |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTION_MODE` | Default execution mode for the examples — `durable` or `blocking`. Each example also has a runtime toggle.                                                | `durable`                 |

A variable already exported in your shell wins over `.env.local` — Next.js loads the file without overwriting what is already in the environment. If a run reaches an endpoint you did not configure here, check your shell first.

**The three keyed build-time scripts want `https://api-dev.pipelex.com` for now.** Running the app needs no override at all, but as measured on 2026-09-05 `api.pipelex.com` is on an older release: it returns neither of `/v1/validate`'s `input_form` and `output_form` views, both of which `npm run codegen` needs for every method, and it does not advertise the `method_ref` selector, which `make add-method` and a package-sourced manifest need. Each script names the missing capability and the base URL rather than failing obscurely. This is a deploy away, and it does not reach a consumer who only runs the app: the committed trees make `git clone && make all` pass with no key and no network.
