// nothing it exercises was written by hand: `make add-method` wrote the action,
// the narrower, the form and the tab from the method's own contract, and the
// method itself is resolved by the address in `methods/text-stats/method.json`
// rather than shipped as a bundle in this repo. A break here says the scaffold's
// templates have drifted from the shared code they compose.
//
// It runs in the default execution mode (durable: start + poll), like the other
// happy-path specs — the form is mode-agnostic, so this is the path a consumer
// gets out of the box. Resolving a `method_ref` needs a base URL that advertises
// it; see the README's note on `PIPELEX_BASE_URL`.
