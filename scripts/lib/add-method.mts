/**
 * `make add-method` — scaffold a method into this app.
 *
 * A method reaches the app in one of three forms, and every form ends in the
 * same slice: the generated tree, the Server Action trio, the typed narrower,
 * the form, a test and the registry entry, written by the same projections so
 * no app file is written by hand.
 *
 *  - **A bundle** — a `.mthds` file or a directory of them. The files are
 *    copied into `methods/<name>/` (a bundle already there is scaffolded in
 *    place) and the action reads them at request time.
 *  - **A catalog id** (`mt_…`) or **a published address** (`github.com/…`) —
 *    the method stays where it is and `methods/<name>/method.json` names it.
 *
 * Two halves, in this order, and the ordering is the whole safety story:
 *
 *  1. **Read-only** (`planAddMethod`). Parse the argument, read the bundle or
 *     check the base URL forwards the selector, fetch the catalog entry, run
 *     `fetchGenerated` (both API calls and every pre-write guard), choose the
 *     pipe, bind the output, derive every name, refuse every collision, and
 *     render and format every file *in memory*, the `ExampleTabs.tsx` insertion
 *     included. Every refusal happens here, with nothing on disk changed.
 *     `--dry-run` stops at the end of it and prints the plan.
 *  2. **Write** (`writeAddMethod`). The method directory, the tree through
 *     `writeGenerated` (the same writer `npm run codegen` uses, so a scaffolded
 *     tree IS the tree a regeneration would write), then the app files and the
 *     registry edit. A failure part-way removes everything the half created and
 *     restores the registry, so a re-run meets no collision of its own making.
 *
 * The gesture is one-shot: re-running it for a name that already exists is a
 * refusal, not an overwrite. `npm run codegen` is the refresh — after editing a
 * bundle, or bumping a published method's tag in `method.json` — and
 * `npm run codegen:check` fails until you run it.
 *
 * Everything above `planAddMethod` is pure and unit-tested over a table; the
 * orchestration takes its repo root and its client from `deps` so the tests can
 * point it at a temporary copy of the tree. The two halves are exported
 * separately, so a caller can plan, act on the plan, and only then write.
