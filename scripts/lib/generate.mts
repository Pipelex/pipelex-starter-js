/**
 * Regenerate the committed typed artifacts for every method in `methods/`.
 *
 * One generated tree per method, mirroring `methods/` one-to-one: each method is
 * its own closure, so each gets its own crate, artifact set, and lock. The tree
 * is written **verbatim** — every `artifacts[]` entry at its `path`, the `lock`
 * as `lock_filename` — because that byte-for-byte fidelity is what makes the
 * tree identical to a local `pipelex codegen types` run, and therefore what lets
 * the offline check (`npm run codegen:check`) pass on it. Reformatting an
 * artifact or re-serializing the lock breaks that trust chain.
 *
 * This is the dev action: it needs an API key and a base URL that serves
 * `/v1/codegen`. The check that guards CI is offline and needs neither.
 *
 * `runGenerate` owns the whole contract, exit code included, so the CLI entry
 * (`scripts/codegen.mts`) stays a one-liner and `writeTree` — the only code in
 * this repo that deletes files — is importable and tested.
