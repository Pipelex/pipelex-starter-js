// Pins `writeTree` — the only code in this repo that deletes files, and until
// the entry/lib split it lived inside a script that could not be imported
// without running a whole regeneration.
//
// The delete rule is the interesting part: what may be removed is
// `runCodegenCheck`'s own `orphan` verdict over the tree just written, never a
// filename test. A weaker rule would delete a consumer's hand-written sibling
// module — the very file the generated header recommends for declaration
// merging — while the offline check calls that same file healthy. So
// `runCodegenCheck` is the one thing mocked here (the rest of the SDK stays
// real, `isStampableArtifactPath` included, because `readGeneratedTree`
// depends on it to keep `sources.json` out of the artifact set).
