 *                    stored error report (the result lookup's, else the status

 * A thrown SDK error — including a narrower throwing `BadPipelineOutputError` /
 * `BadImageOutputError`, or `RunLifecycleUnavailableError` — is classified, and
 * the failure carries a `transient` flag (see `isTransientPollError`) so the
 * client poll loop can keep polling through a momentary 5xx, rate limit or
 * network blip instead of abandoning a run that is still completing
 * server-side. Its retry line is dropped: the verdict judged the read, not the
 * run, and offering a re-run of a run that may still be executing would start
 * a second one.
