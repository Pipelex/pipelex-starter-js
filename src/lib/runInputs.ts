/**
 * The run-input gate — the server half of the kernel's input rules.
 *
 * The two sides are not the same call, and it is worth being exact about that.
 * The browser runs `computeReadiness` to decide whether Run is live
 * (`useRunInputs`); this module runs the kernel's `gateRunInputs`, which
 * validates shapes, re-applies the readiness rules over the same derived
 * fields, and builds the wire envelope. So the rules are shared by
 * construction, not by resemblance, while this side stays a strict superset of
 * the browser's.
 *
 * That superset property is the invariant to preserve, because a Server Action
 * is a public endpoint and the browser's checks are trivially bypassed. This is
 * the trust boundary; readiness is UX. The kernel asserts the invariant in its
 * own suite by running both sides over one table of structured fixtures;
 * `runInputs.test.ts` re-asserts it over this repo's committed contracts, which
 * is what would catch a method redesign that reaches a shape the kernel's
 * fixtures do not.
 *
 * What remains here is presentation: the kernel returns a verdict
 * (`missingInputs`, raw ajv `errors`), and this module renders it as the
 * `bad_request` `PipelineError` the template's `<ErrorDisplay>` knows how to
 * show.
 *
 * Pure module — no `process.env`, no Node built-ins — so it is safe to import
 * from either side (same rule as `fileEncoding.ts`).
