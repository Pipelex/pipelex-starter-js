/**
 * The host side of the form kernel's file seam, in one hook.
 *
 * The kernel never uploads: a `DocumentField` or `ImageField` fires
 * `env.onDropFile(id, file)` and waits, and the host is expected to store the
 * file and write a `FileValue` (`{url, filename}`) back at the field's dotted
 * path. This hook stores it in Pipelex storage, straight from the browser:
 *
 * 1. It asks the method's Server Action for an upload grant, sending the file's
 *    name, type and size — never its bytes. The action holds the API key and
 *    checks the type and the size before asking the platform for the grant.
 * 2. It sends the file itself to storage with `uploadWithGrant`, a `PUT` the
 *    grant signed for exactly that type and size.
 * 3. It writes the grant's `pipelex-storage://` reference into the form.
 *
 * So the run that follows carries references and no bytes, however many files
 * a list input holds: the bytes cross neither this app's server nor the API
 * gateway, and nothing caps a submission but the platform's limit on one file.
 *
 * The rules it keeps, each of which is a bug when dropped:
 *
 *  - **Clear before every await.** Every path that is about to replace a
 *    selection un-sets the value *before* its first await, so the form's value
 *    is only ever a successfully stored file: a replacement still in flight, or
 *    one that fails, leaves nothing behind to submit by accident.
 *  - **Stay busy for the whole operation, not just one step.** While an id is
 *    in `uploadingIds` the kernel shuts every door into that value — the
 *    dropzone, the "paste a URL instead" toggle, the URL input behind it — and
 *    shows a spinner. The grant request and the upload are one operation: a
 *    window between them where the field is writable is a window where an older
 *    selection lands last and silently replaces the newer.
 *  - **Write the reference only once storage has the file.** A grant's URI
 *    names nothing until storage answers the `PUT`, so a form holding it any
 *    earlier would start a run that fails on a missing object.
 *  - **Check the size before asking.** Purely to save a round trip: the grant
 *    action checks the same exported constant, and the platform's own limit is
 *    the authority behind both.
 *
 * `uploadingIds` is a set rather than a refcount, which matters for a caller
 * that nests one `dropFile` inside its own busy span (a sample-file shortcut
 * that fetches a file and then drops it does): the inner release frees the field while the outer span is
 * still open. That is safe only because nothing awaits after the inner call
 * returns.
