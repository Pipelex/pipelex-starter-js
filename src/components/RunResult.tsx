 * The one kernel composition on the output side — `<RunInputsForm>`'s twin.
 *
 * The result is rendered from the method's own contract, exactly as the form
 * above it is: `OUTPUT_FORM` says what the output IS (its kind, its nesting,
 * whether it is plural) and the contract's `output.json_schema` says what shape
 * the payload arrives in, and `requireResultField` pairs them into the single
 * `RunField` handed here. Nothing in this component knows what
 * `extract_entities` produces, and nothing inspects the value to decide how to
 * lay it out — swap the method, re-run codegen, and the view follows.
 *
 * `StuffViewer` gives the two views a result actually needs: **Rendered**, the
 * descriptor-driven view for a person, and **JSON**, the verbatim receipt for
 * whoever is debugging the pipe. `presentation="app"` is the same seam
 * `<RunInputsForm>` uses and must stay in step with it: humanized labels and no
 * concept pills, because a result and the form that produced it show the same
 * fields and must read the same way.
 *
 * **Not wired yet, and deliberately:** a `pipelex-storage://` reference resolves
 * nowhere in a browser, and the kernel's seam for exchanging one is a
 * `<ResultEnvProvider resolveUrl>` mounted above this. The hosted runtime
 * returns a signed `public_url` beside the storage URI and the kernel's file
 * arms prefer it, so every file this template produces displays without one —
 * which is why a resolver over the SDK's `resolveStorageUrl` is a follow-up
 * rather than a prerequisite. Add it as one provider high in the tree, not as a
 * prop threaded through here.
