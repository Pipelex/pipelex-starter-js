/**
 * Marks the page as hydrated, so a script driving it has something to wait on.
 *
 * Until React has hydrated the page, its controls are server-rendered markup
 * with no handlers attached. A script that acts in that window gets two kinds of
 * wrong answer. A file it sets never reaches the drop handler that uploads it.
 * And a Playwright screenshot, which hides the caret by writing
 * `caret-color: transparent` into the inline style of every input, rewrites an
 * attribute React then finds changed, so `next dev` reports a hydration
 * mismatch that no person's browser would ever see. Waiting for
 * `html[data-hydrated]` closes both.
 *
 * The mark is set on `<html>` rather than on a form because it speaks for the
 * whole page — every tab's form, and the tab switcher around them. It is exact
 * for this app as it stands: the whole page hydrates in the root's one commit,
 * and this effect runs after it. **A `loading.tsx`, a `<Suspense>` boundary or a
 * `dynamic()` import changes that**, because React hydrates each boundary on its
 * own, later: the mark would then be set before what is inside the boundary is
 * live, and an app that adds one should set its own mark inside the boundary.
