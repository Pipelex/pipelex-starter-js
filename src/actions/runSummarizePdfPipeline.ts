/**
 * Build the run options through the SDK's signature-driven `prepareInputs`
 * instead of hand-rolling a `Document` envelope.
 *
 * `prepareInputs` reads the method's declared signature (`document` is a
 * `Document` input) and shapes the file position as the run expects it. The PDF
 * itself is already in Pipelex storage — the browser stored it with a grant from
 * `requestSummarizePdfUpload` — so the `pipelex-storage://` reference at
 * `document` passes through untouched, and the run request carries that
 * reference, never the bytes. It takes the kernel's explicit `{concept, content}`
 * envelope as readily as a bare value — verified live against the hosted API —
 * and preserves the envelope on output, so the gate's payload goes straight in.
 * `pipe_ref` names the pipe rather than leaving it to the closure's `main_pipe`.
 * Since SDK 0.19.0 a validation report stating `default_pipe_ref: null` is the
 * server saying it determined no entry pipe, and preparation refuses there
 * instead of falling back — so the ref is stated, exactly as `make add-method`
 * scaffolds it. It is the qualified `<domain>.<pipe_code>` form; a bare pipe
 * code is refused.
 *
 * On failure `prepareInputs` throws *before any run starts* (a typed
 * `InputPreparationError` — see `classifyInputPreparationError`). Because this
 * closure runs inside `executeBlockingRun` / `startDurableRun`'s try/catch, that
 * error is classified like any other SDK error — no new try/catch here. On the
 * durable path the preparation happens once, at start; `poll` never rebuilds
 * options.
