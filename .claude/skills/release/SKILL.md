  Cut a release of pipelex-starter-js, the Next.js starter template that runs
  .mthds methods through @pipelex/sdk: the release/vX.Y.Z worktree, the
  package.json bump and the package-lock.json that follows, the changelog entry,
  the gates, one commit, and a pull request to main. Use when the user says
  "release", "cut a release", "bump version", "prepare a release", "new
  version", "make a release", "ship it", "create release branch", "promote dev
  to main", or any variation of shipping a new version of the starter.
  Changelog content passed inline ("/release Added a tab for the new method")
  becomes the entry. The merge is landed by /ledger-land, never by this skill.

# Releasing pipelex-starter-js

The procedure is the workspace release play, [`docs/releasing.md`](../../../../docs/releasing.md) at the workspace root — `../docs/releasing.md` from this repo's own root, which resolves the same from the main checkout and from any worktree. Read it first, then run it with what follows. The repo key is `pipelex-starter-js`, the base is `dev`, and the pull request targets `main`. The release worktree is `_pipelex-starter-js--release`, made with `wt add pipelex-starter-js release --branch release/vX.Y.Z`; the repo declares no `.worktree.toml`, so `wt` resolves the base from `origin/dev`, and provisioning runs the Makefile's `install` target, which is the `npm install` that puts the `node_modules` every gate below needs into the worktree.

## What ships

**Nothing is published, and that is the whole answer.** `package.json` declares `"private": true`, so nothing goes to npm. `.github/workflows/` holds `lint-check.yml` and `tests-check.yml`, and both open with `on: pull_request:` — no workflow in this repo fires on a push to `main`, so the merge triggers no build, no publish and no tagger. The repo carries no tags and no GitHub Releases, and none are made by hand. What the merge produces is the template at its new version on `main`, which is this repo's default branch and therefore what a consumer clones.

The landing has no publish to verify, so it verifies the merge and the version that reached `main`:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit            # MERGED, and the merge commit
git -C <main> fetch --prune origin
git -C <main> show origin/main:package.json | grep '"version"'   # X.Y.Z
```

## Version files and the lock

- **`package.json`** — the `"version"` field, without a `v` prefix. It is the only place in the tree the number is written: nothing in `src/`, the docs or the README restates it.
- **The lock** — `make lock` (`npm install --package-lock-only`), run after the bump. It rewrites the two `"version"` fields `package-lock.json` carries for this package — the top-level one and the one under `packages[""]` — and leaves `node_modules` alone. If it fails, stop and report it rather than committing a lock that disagrees with `package.json`: `npm ci` refuses that pair, and `npm ci` is the first step of both CI workflows.
- **Also stamped:** nothing.

## Gates

Run in the worktree, in this order, before the commit. Every one of them is blocking.

1. **`make all`** — `check` (ESLint, Prettier's `--check`, the three `tsc` passes over the app, the Playwright specs and `scripts/`, and the offline `codegen-check`), then `test` (the Vitest suite; `make agent-test` is the same run kept quiet on success), then `build` (`next build`). It rewrites no tracked file, because the formatting step only checks: the cure for a red `format-check` is `make format`, which does rewrite, and whatever it touches then joins the release commit. A red `codegen-check` means a bundle under `methods/` moved without a regeneration — the cure is `make codegen` with a key, never a hand-edit under `src/generated/`, which is stamped and would fail the check as `hand-edited`.
2. **`make codegen-verify`, whenever `PIPELEX_API_KEY` is set** — the semantic half of the codegen trust chain, and the gate `CLAUDE.md` names as the one to run before a release. It re-resolves each method live and compares crate fingerprints against the committed locks; it writes nothing and costs no LLM call. It needs a base URL that serves what the keyed scripts ask for — read `CLAUDE.md`'s "Generated types" section for which one, since that has moved. **An engine-version difference in its output is a note, not a failure**: `engine_version` rides in every artifact stamp, so an upstream `pipelex` release restamps the whole tree with no semantic change, and the restamp belongs to a deliberate commit rather than to the release.
3. **`make test-e2e`, only when the release touches the SDK call path, and only with the user's approval** — `CLAUDE.md`'s "Workflow Rules" section names that path file by file, and it reaches further than a module name suggests: the SDK client and the bundle loader are on it alongside `src/actions/`, `src/hooks/useRun.ts`, `src/generated/` and `methods/`. Read the list there rather than deciding from memory which of `src/lib/` counts. The specs hit the live Pipelex API and cost an LLM call each, which is why the target prompts through `confirm-live-e2e` before spending and why the suite auto-skips without a key. It starts `next dev`, and `next dev` re-writes the agent-rules block at the bottom of `AGENTS.md`, a tracked file — if that leaves a change, it joins the release commit rather than being reverted.

## The release commit

`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, plus anything `make format` rewrote and `AGENTS.md` if `make test-e2e` re-wrote its agent-rules block — staged by name.

## CI on the release pull request

The repo has two workflows and both fire on `on: pull_request:` with no branch and no path filter, so the release pull request meets exactly what every pull request meets:

- **`lint-check.yml`** — `npm ci` then `make check` on Node 22.
- **`tests-check.yml`** — `npm ci`, then `make agent-test`, then `make build`, on the same Node.

There is no version check, no changelog check and no branch guard here: nothing in CI asserts that `package.json` agrees with the version in the branch name, that `CHANGELOG.md` carries the entry, that no `[Unreleased]` heading survives, or that a head into `main` is a `release/` branch at all. Those are the play's rules and this skill's job, held by nothing else. The `npm ci` step is the one indirect gate — it fails when `package-lock.json` and `package.json` disagree, which is what catches a skipped lock step.

## Particulars

- **The changelog headings carry the `v`** — `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, which is what every entry in `CHANGELOG.md` reads. No `[Unreleased]` heading is left behind; the next change re-creates one.
- **No pre-release form.** Since no workflow reads the branch name, an `rc` would be caught by nothing at all — ship a plain `X.Y.Z`.
- **`.worktreeinclude` names the gitignored files a fresh worktree needs** — `.env`, `.env.local` and `.claude/settings.local.json` — and `wt add` provisions them. `PIPELEX_API_KEY` is read from `.env.local`, so `make codegen-verify` and `make test-e2e` work in `_pipelex-starter-js--release` only because that file was copied in; a gate that fails there on a missing key means the file was not.
- **The two Pipelex dependencies are bumped by their own skills, not by this play.** `@pipelex/sdk` and `@pipelex/mthds-form` sit in `package.json` as pre-1.0 caret ranges, which npm never resolves across a minor, so moving either is a deliberate edit — `/bump-sdk` and `/bump-mthds-form` are what make it, each reading the package's changelog and applying the renames. A release neither performs nor implies one.
- **Measure the gates against the npm-published packages.** `make use-local` swaps those same two packages for tarballs packed from the sibling `../pipelex-sdk-js` and `../mthds-form` checkouts, and it installs them `--no-save`, so `package.json` records nothing and a green build proves only that the siblings work. A worktree freshly provisioned by `wt add` holds the published versions, which is the state to release from; `make use-npm` restores them.
- **The pre-commit hook rewrites the files the release commit carries.** `.husky/pre-commit` runs `npx lint-staged`, whose configuration sends every staged `*.{css,json,md}` through `prettier --write` and re-stages what it changed, so `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` are reformatted as the commit is made; `package-lock.json` sits in `.prettierignore` and passes through untouched. That is what keeps a hand-written changelog entry from failing `lint-check.yml`, whose `make check` formats against `**/*.md` and `**/*.json` — the entry and the bump are both written after the gates have run, so the hook is the only formatter that ever sees them. Expect the committed text to differ from what was typed, and never reach for `--no-verify`, which is the one way an unformatted entry reaches CI.
- **The dev server's port is guarded, and the guard names the holder.** `make test-e2e` runs through `port-check`, which refuses `APP_PORT` (4300 by default) when another checkout is serving it and prints that checkout's directory. Every worktree of this repo wants the same port, so the holder is routinely another branch's copy of this same app — `APP_PORT=4301` on the target is the way past it.
