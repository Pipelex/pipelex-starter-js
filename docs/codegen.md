# Codegen: generated types from `.mthds` bundles

This is the reference for the code-generation workflow behind `src/generated/` — why it exists, how the commands relate, what the trust chain guarantees, and the one workaround it currently carries. The day-to-day rules live in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) ("Generated types"); this document is the deeper "why" behind them.

## Why

This template's role is to show developers how to build on Pipelex, and everything our tools can build deterministically should be built by them. Before codegen, the template hand-wrote in `src/types/` the very thing each method already declares in its `.mthds` bundle: the output concept's shape plus a hand-rolled runtime narrower per shape. That is a duplicated type surface with no drift guard — edit a bundle's structure and nothing tells you the TypeScript is now lying.

`@pipelex/sdk` exposes the crate routes: `client.codegen({ kind: "types", target: "ts-zod" })` projects a method's normalized library crate into stamped typed artifacts — a `types.ts` (zod schemas + inferred types), a `binder.ts` (typed `parse<Name>` / `serialize<Name>` pairs), and a `codegen.lock` — byte-identical to a local `pipelex codegen types` run. The same run additionally asks `/v1/validate` for the method's pipe IO contracts and its wire input-form descriptor (opting in with `views: ["input_form"]`) and writes a `contracts.ts` (see [The contracts artifact](#the-contracts-artifact)), so the same command that keeps the _output_ types honest also keeps the _input_ forms honest. The SDK also ships `runCodegenCheck`, the pure offline drift check: a port of pipelex's `codegen check` that reaches the same verdict over the same bytes, down to the drift `detail` sentences.

The design goal in one sentence: **`npm run codegen` regenerates committed, typed, zod-validated artifacts for every method in `methods/`, `npm run codegen:check` proves offline that they are current, and the app's narrowers are thin adapters over the generated binders.**

## The commands

The npm scripts are the primary interface — this is a JS template and `npm run` is what its consumers reach for. The Make targets (`make codegen`, `make codegen-check`, `make codegen-verify`) are thin wrappers.

| Command                  | What it does                                                                                                                         | Needs network / key?                                       | When                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run codegen`        | Regenerate `src/generated/<method>/` for every method in `methods/`, via `POST /v1/codegen`                                          | Yes — `PIPELEX_API_KEY` + a base URL that serves the route | Dev action: after editing any `.mthds` file            |
| `npm run codegen:check`  | Offline drift check of every generated tree against its `codegen.lock` and sources sidecar                                           | No — pure hashing                                          | CI action: part of `make check`, so `make all` runs it |
| `npm run codegen:verify` | Re-run `codegen()` live and compare its `crate_fingerprint` to each committed lock's — the _semantic_ staleness gate. Writes nothing | Yes — same as `codegen`                                    | Before a release, or in a keyed CI job                 |

Regeneration is the dev action, the offline check is the CI action — the split pipelex's codegen engine is designed around, so engine improvements never redden a consumer's CI. `npm run codegen` stays out of `make all` for the same reason `test-e2e` does: it needs a key and a network.

```

One generated tree per method, mirroring `methods/` one-to-one: each method is its own closure, so each gets its own crate, artifact set, and lock. The trees live under `src/` so the `@/` alias reaches them and `tsc` type-checks them as part of the app.

## Two source kinds

A method directory says where its method lives, and there are two answers. It holds either **`.mthds` files** — the bundle is in this repo, which is the four demo methods — or a **`method.json` manifest** naming a method that lives elsewhere:

```json
{ "method_ref": "github.com/Pipelex/methods/text_stats@v0.1.1" }
```

Exactly one selector key, `method_ref` (a published package address) or `method_id` (a method saved under your key's organization), as a non-empty string; both keys, neither, an unknown key, or a non-string value is a refusal with no verdict, the way a non-UTF-8 source is. A directory holding **both** kinds is refused naming the two, because they would disagree about where the tree came from; a directory holding neither is skipped, as it always was.

`discoverMethods` returns a `MethodSource` discriminated on `kind`, with `name` and `sourceHashes` common to both arms — so every kind-blind gate reads those two members and needed no change at all. In particular:

- **The offline check is untouched in logic.** `compareSidecar` hashes `method.json` exactly the way it hashes a bundle, so editing a tag and forgetting to regenerate fails `make check` with the same "run `npm run codegen`" remedy. That is the feature, not a side effect: **bumping a published method's version is a one-line edit plus a regeneration.**
- **Orphan detection is unchanged** — a generated tree with no `methods/<name>/` behind it is still an orphan, and a method with no tree is still the other half.
- **`npm run codegen` regenerates both kinds in one pass.** A selector-sourced tree is not a second regeneration path; `make add-method` writes its tree by calling the generator's own halves, so a scaffolded tree is byte-for-byte the tree a regeneration would write.

What actually differs is two calls. For a bundle source, `validateFiles(files, { views: ["input_form"] })` and `codegen({ files, … })`; for a selector source, `validate(selector, …, ["input_form"])` and `codegen({ ...selector, … })`. `codegen:verify` branches the same way, re-resolving by selector where it re-resolves by files.

Two consequences worth stating plainly. A **`method_id`** slice regenerates only with a key of the same organization, since the catalog is org-scoped — which is why the template itself ships only an address-sourced slice. And a selector is resolved **server-side**, so the base URL has to forward it; see the handshake below.

[`docs/add-method.md`](add-method.md) is the reference for the gesture that writes a manifest and the app files around it.

**Committed, deliberately.** A template consumer must see the generated code without holding an API key, `git clone && make all` must pass keyless, and the diff of a regeneration is itself documentation of what a bundle edit changed. The offline check keeps the committed tree honest.

## The contracts artifact

`src/generated/<method>/contracts.ts` is the one artifact in the tree the codegen route does not produce. It carries two payloads of one `POST /v1/validate` call, both keyed by namespaced pipe ref and typed against the form kernel's re-exports through a type-only import: `PIPE_IO_CONTRACTS` (the `pipe_io_contracts` payload — what the run gate validates against) and `INPUT_FORM` (the `input_form` payload, the wire input-form descriptor requested with `views: ["input_form"]` — what [the input forms](input-form.md) derive their fields from, co-walking the contract). One file for both, deliberately: same response, same keys, consumed together. They belong beside the types for exactly the same reason those are committed: a consumer must see them without a key, and the diff of a regeneration shows what a bundle edit changed.

`INPUT_FORM` is emitted with an `as InputForm` assertion rather than a `:` annotation, and that is a workaround with an expiry (the same genre as `dropWireNulls`): the deployed hosted engine still emits a `name` on a list's `item`, a member the standard's closed shape forbids and `InputFormItem` therefore does not declare, so tsc's excess-property check rejects the annotated literal. The fix is upstream in pipelex 0.54.0 (#1155); once the hosted engine carries it, a regeneration drops the member and the emitter reverts to the annotation so the compiler guards the emitted shape again.

It is fetched with the SDK's `validateFiles`, not `validate`. Not for ergonomics: `validate` takes parallel `mthds_contents` / `mthds_sources` arrays and the server `422`s a length mismatch, so hand-building them is a latent bug that surfaces at the first two-bundle method. The call is placed **last** in the per-method sequence, after the codegen artifacts have passed their own self-check, so a failed validate leaves the tree untouched rather than half-updated. An `is_valid: false` verdict fails the method exactly like a failed codegen.

**It carries no codegen stamp, deliberately.** The SDK's orphan rule is "a _stamped_ file the lock does not track", and the writer deletes orphans — an emitter that imitated the stamped files beside it would produce a file that silently vanished on every regeneration.

That leaves it outside the lock's protection, which is not acceptable when the two artifacts beside it are protected against precisely this. Re-signing the lock locally was rejected — the lock signs what `POST /v1/codegen` returned, and forging that destroys the one property that makes a committed tree traceable to a server response. So the `sources.json` sidecar grew a second half: a `derived` map of artifact filename → SHA-256, written by the generator from the content it wrote, compared by the offline check. Two shapes inside it are load-bearing: the hash is taken from the **written content**, not a re-read, and the expected set is a **constant** (`DERIVED_ARTIFACTS`), never the sidecar's own keys — otherwise an empty `derived` map certifies itself. The check reports the usual four states: hand-edited, missing, unrecorded, and recorded-but-no-longer-generated.

`codegen:verify` covers it too, by re-fetching `/v1/validate` and comparing the **rendered bytes** (which is why the renderer is shared by all three scripts). The crate fingerprint says nothing about a different route's response, and an artifact no keyed gate covers is one nobody will notice has gone stale. One asymmetry with the fingerprint check: an engine bump is a _note_ there, because `engine_version` rides in every stamp; contracts carry no engine version, so any difference in them is a real content difference and is reported as a failure.

## The trust chain

**The server's artifacts are written verbatim.** Every `artifacts[]` entry lands at its `path` and the lock content at `codegen.lock`, byte-for-byte, so the tree is identical to a local `pipelex codegen types` run — same stamps, same lock — and the offline check holds. Editing an artifact or re-serializing the lock breaks the chain, which is why `src/generated/` is excluded from Prettier and ESLint (the emitter targets Prettier's defaults at 80 columns; this repo prints at 100, so a reformat would rewrite bytes and break every stamp). `tsc` keeps full coverage — the trees are inside `src/` and the base tsconfig — and that is the check that matters.

The generator also mirrors pipelex's own write discipline:

- **Write-if-changed** — no mtime churn, clean diffs, a full regeneration over a current tree is a true no-op.
- **Orphan cleanup defers to the checker.** Stale artifacts that dropped out of the set are removed, but the authority on what may be removed is `runCodegenCheck`'s own `orphan` verdict over the tree just written — not a filename test. A suffix test answers "could this file type be an artifact"; the SDK's orphan rule additionally requires the file to carry a codegen stamp. Deleting on the weaker test would destroy any hand-written sibling `.ts` a consumer parks in the tree — the very "sibling module" the generated header recommends for declaration merging. Deferring to the check makes the writer and the checker agree by construction.
- **A renamed lock is refused, not followed.** The offline check opens `codegen.lock` by name; if the server ever returns a different `lock_filename`, silently following it would leave the old lock in place for the check to keep validating — green, from the wrong file. The writer reports it and writes nothing.
- **Self-verify before writing.** The generator runs `runCodegenCheck` over the server's own response before touching disk; a tree that would fail its own check is never written.

## Two staleness gates, because they answer different questions

The offline check proves the tree matches the lock; it deliberately never proves the tree is current with the _bundles_, since that needs the engine. So there are two gates:

- **Offline (`codegen:check`, in `make check`)** — the `sources.json` sidecar. `npm run codegen` writes it beside each lock: the repo-relative path and SHA-256 of everything the method is generated from — every source `.mthds` in the closure, or the `method.json` manifest naming where it lives — compared on every check. Edit a bundle or bump a manifest's tag, forget to regenerate, and `make check` fails with "run `npm run codegen`" instead of shipping silently stale types. Coarse and knowingly so — a byte hash where the crate fingerprint is semantic, so reformatting a bundle trips a false "stale" whose remedy is a regeneration that write-if-changed turns into a clean no-op. Hashing normalizes CRLF and lone CR first, so a Windows checkout is not a false stale. The sidecar is starter-owned, unstamped, and outside the lock (which stays byte-exact); the check also covers the whole-tree cases a single tree cannot see — a method with no generated tree, and a generated tree with no method behind it.
- **Keyed (`codegen:verify`)** — the semantic gate the sidecar approximates. The script re-runs `codegen()` live and compares its `crate_fingerprint` against each committed lock's, writing nothing. No false positives on reformatting — the fingerprint is semantic — but it needs a key and a network, so it stays out of `make all` and complements the sidecar rather than replacing it.

**Exit codes are a contract**: `0` current, `1` drift or stale sources, `2` no verdict. No-verdict causes: a missing or malformed lock; a `lock_version` this SDK build does not know (whose message names the version found and says to bump `@pipelex/sdk`, not to touch the tree); a refused symlink or special file; a non-UTF-8 `.mthds` source; or any other tree-read failure — in that last case the check prints the underlying message and never the regenerate remedy, which would claim a verdict the run did not produce. Aggregation across methods is by precedence — no-verdict outranks drift outranks current — because as long as any method could not be checked, the run has not produced the full verdict a `0` or `1` would claim. A per-category summary line (`N current · N drift · N no verdict`) at the end shows the mix the single exit code cannot.

## Gate fidelity policies

The verdicts above are only worth trusting because of a few deliberately loud policies in the shared layer (`scripts/lib/shared.mts`), each of which replaced a way the gate could be _silently wrong_:

- **Symlinks and special files are refused by name.** Anything under `methods/` or a generated tree that is not a regular file or a directory — a symlink, FIFO, or socket, including a symlinked tree root, method directory, or the `methods/` / `src/generated/` roots themselves — throws `SymlinkRefusedError` naming the path, and the check reports no verdict. Following symlinks would need cycle handling, and a symlinked `.mthds` used to drop out of the codegen closure _and_ `sources.json`, so editing it never tripped `stale-source`.
- **UTF-8 decoding is fatal.** Every text read goes through `readTextFile`, which throws `NonUtf8FileError` instead of substituting U+FFFD. A lossy decode could hash a corrupted artifact to its locked value and report it `current`. The error maps by ownership: in a generated tree it is drift (regenerating rewrites the file), in a `.mthds` source it is a refusal (regenerating would ship garbage to the API).
- **A case-mismatched tree gets a rename remedy, never a delete.** On a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS's default) the per-method check happily opens a tree whose on-disk name differs from the method's in case only and certifies it current; a byte-wise orphan scan would then print a delete remedy for that same tree. The scan case-folds the comparison and reports "rename `src/generated/<X>/` to `<y>`" as drift.
- **Orphan detection runs even when `methods/` is empty.** Generated trees left behind after the last method was removed report as orphans (drift), not "nothing to check"; only empty-and-clean keeps the no-verdict exit.
- **The scripts are cwd-independent.** `REPO_ROOT` anchors on `import.meta.dirname`, not `process.cwd()`, so running a script from any directory produces the same verdict instead of a raw ENOENT.
- **A server-named artifact path may not escape its tree.** `codegen.mts` runs every `artifact.path` in the response through `isContainedPath` before the first write, and refuses the whole method — nothing written — if one resolves outside `src/generated/<method>/`. `writeIfChanged` creates directories recursively, so a `..` in a path the writer trusted would land a file wherever the process can reach, in a place no stamp guards and no check ever looks. This is the response half of the same exposure the base-URL guard below closes on the wire.
- **The keyed scripts refuse a plaintext `http:` base URL for any non-loopback host** (`assertSecureBaseUrl`; `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]` are allowed). They send the API key as a bearer token and write server-supplied TypeScript into the repo, so a non-local plaintext URL exposes both on the wire.
- **A base URL that cannot resolve a selector is named before anything is fetched.** When any discovered source is selector-sourced, the keyed scripts ask `GET /v1/version` once and refuse — nothing written — if its `extensions` array lacks the kind they need, naming the base URL, the missing kind, and what it does advertise. Without the handshake the failure is a bare `403`, which on an env-scoped key says nothing at all about forwarding. Two cases deliberately **proceed** rather than refuse, because the handshake has no verdict to give and the real call's own error is the better message: the handshake itself failing, and a response that advertises no capabilities at all. `explain()` learns the matching resolution failures — a 404 from a selector call means the route is there and the method is not, so the server's own message (which for a bad address lists the packages the repository does contain) is printed **verbatim** rather than replaced by a guess about `PIPELEX_BASE_URL`.

**An engine bump restamps everything, and that is expected.** `engine_version` rides in the artifact stamps, so an upstream pipelex release restamps the whole tree with zero semantic change — `crate_fingerprint` is the semantic signal, and it stays put. `codegen:verify` reports an engine difference as a **note**, not a failure, leaving the whole-tree restamp to a deliberate commit.

## The narrowers are adapters, and the one workaround

Each `parseXxx(results: RunResults)` narrower in `src/types/` hands `wireOutput(results)` to the generated binder and translates a thrown `ZodError` into the template's tagged error model (`describeSchemaFailure` renders it through `z.prettifyError`, because a `ZodError`'s own `.message` is a JSON dump). Hand-written validation survives only where it adds semantics the concept does not declare — `parseGeneratedImage`'s web-renderable-URL check is the single example. Generated types flow to the components with their wire-native snake_case keys (`doc_type`, `public_url`); a camelCase mirror would be exactly the duplicated surface codegen removes.

**`dropWireNulls` is a workaround with an expiry, not a design.** The ts-zod projection emits a non-required concept field as `.optional()`, which in zod means `| undefined` and **rejects `null`** — but the runtime serializes an unset optional field as an explicit `null`, because `WorkingMemory.dump_for_transport()` is a `model_dump(serialize_as_any=True)` with no `exclude_none`. This was traced through the emitter, the pydantic defaults, and the transport dump, then **confirmed against a live hosted run** rather than trusted: a `PipeImgGen` run's `main_stuff` carries `caption: null`, `filename: null`, and `source_negative_prompt: null`, so without normalization `parseImage` throws on every real image run — the naive adoption would have shipped an example broken in production and green in unit tests.

The strip is **schema-guided, and that is load-bearing**. `dropWireNulls(value, schema)` takes the concept's generated zod schema and descends only declared shapes: an object field is dropped only when the schema says a `null` there means absence (it accepts `undefined`, rejects `null`, and carries no `.default()` to invent), arrays and record _values_ are descended for their declared element type, and anything opaque — `z.unknown()`, `z.any()`, a union, a `z.record()`'s keys — is passed through untouched. A blind deep strip is precisely what the ts-zod emitter's own design note rules out: inside a `z.record()` a `null` is _data_, and stripping it deletes a value before the schema can object, silently and with a green check. `src/lib/wireOutput.test.ts` pins each of those cases.

It normalizes **values, never names** — it re-declares no field, so it is not the duplicated surface codegen removes — and it is deletable the day the emitter projects non-required fields as `.nullish()` (or the transport dump excludes unset fields). Reported upstream to pipelex; revisit at each pipelex release.

## What is deliberately not built

- **The manifest is the whole of the selector story on this side.** `method.json` names where a method lives and nothing else; the scripts gained a second source kind and no second regeneration path, no download-the-closure-locally mode, and no per-kind gate. Everything else the selector makes possible — the app files, the tab — belongs to [`make add-method`](add-method.md), not here.
- **No `resolve` example.** Codegen subsumes it for this template's purpose; the bare crate becomes interesting only for fingerprint-based caching or a custom projection.
- **No generated-code edits, ever.** Customization rides sibling extension files; the adapters in `src/types/` _are_ that sibling layer here.
- **No watch mode, no build-time hook.** Regeneration stays an explicit dev action; wiring it into `next dev` or `next build` would put a network + key dependency inside the build. The sidecar check is the forgetting-guard.
- **No per-pipe kinds.** `kind: "types"` is concept-set-wide and is the only kind served today.

## Open questions

- **The `.optional()`-versus-wire-`null` mismatch** is the one thing here that is a workaround rather than a design. `dropWireNulls` should be deleted, not maintained — the fix belongs in the emitter (or the transport dump), and it is reported upstream.
- **`sources.json` upstreaming**: if the staleness sidecar proves its worth, it may belong in the engine's own lock story rather than a starter convention. The `derived` half is the stronger candidate — any host that commits a codegen tree and emits its own artifact into it faces the same hole, and the machinery is small but easy to get subtly wrong; its natural home is beside `runCodegenCheck` in `@pipelex/sdk`.
- **The wire descriptor landed at exactly the seam built for it — beside the contracts, not in place of them.** This bullet used to say the contracts artifact was a placeholder for a purpose-built input-form descriptor, and that adopting it would be a one-artifact change at one call site. That held: the descriptor arrived as `/v1/validate`'s `views: ["input_form"]` opt-in, the fetch in the generator gained one option and one field, and the artifact stayed one file. What the placeholder framing got wrong is that the descriptor _replaces_ the contracts: the kernel co-walks the contract for the two facts the wire deliberately omits (the scalar wrapper key, nested list bounds), and the run gate validates against the contract alone — so `contracts.ts` carries both payloads.
- **`lock_version` upgrade ordering**: an SDK that tolerates a new lock version must ship _before_ the pipelex release that starts writing it. If `make check` ever fails with a version message naming a version this SDK does not know, the fix is bumping `@pipelex/sdk`, not touching the generated tree.
